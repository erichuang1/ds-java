## Getting Started

Welcome to the ds-java project on GitHub! This project aims to design and implement a plain/vanilla version of client-side simulator that acts as a simple job dispatcher for the ds-sim simulation protocol as described in the ds-sim user guide.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `ds-server`: the folder containing ds-server and its components
- `src`: the folder to maintain sources

The compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
